=======

Crafter Profile is the user repository component of Crafter CMS. It's used for authentication and authorization (optionally), for user meta-data augmentation (if the master is some foreign user management system), and for personalization. For more information, please visit: http://docs.craftercms.org/en/3.1/developers/projects/profile/index.html
